## Project Idea
**Carpool/Ride-shareing Android App**: Carpool and save the planet

The world is going through a dramatic change in the climate. This is happening because of the carbon emissions that we pump into the atmosphere on a daily basis. Around 30 percent of the total U.S. carbon emissions come from transportation, out of which 60 percent emissions are contributed by cars and light trucks. [(Source)](http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_vehicles/why-clean-cars/global-warming/) Moving to cleaner vehicles is an essential, but a slow, process.

Also, the highways in major cities are overloaded with traffic and are clogged during the peak hours. The annual congestion cost per consumer is more than $1000 in some cities. [(Source)](http://traffic.findthebest.com) This is in addition to the time spent waiting in traffic.

An important facility provided by the government is the carpool lane. By carpooling with other commuters one can:
- reduce the carbon footprint
- reduce the traffic congestion
- save time 
- save money
- achieve peace of mind.

When carpooling, the first challenge is to find people to ride along. Scheduling and communicating with fellow commuters can also be a headache if not done right. We propose to solve all the hassles involved with planning out a carpool and make it a fun experience.
